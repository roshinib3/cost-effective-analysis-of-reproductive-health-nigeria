# Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Increased Reproductive Health Access in Nigeria

A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis evaluates the health and costs of interventions (as opposed to the status quo). Each intervention and the status quo is evaluated by the ratio between net cost and changes in health outcome for each scenario. It is a common tool in Health Decision Science to develop data-driven recommendations.
